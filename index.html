Our The Flat Rate Repair Service Is  $125

That's So Don't You Need Worry About Inflating Repair Costs!

We believe fair pricing is key to sustainable, long-term business with you

Free estimates - we do not charge a diagnosis fee.

Taking apart your device to determine what is wrong with it costs $0 here.

We believe diagnostic fees are predatory in the repair business.

Humble - We do not perform jobs we cannot do properly.   You will hear us beg you to go elsewhere if we feel we are not the best fit for a job. Our goal is to make you happy; with taking your money as a side benefit. If we can only do one without the other, we will not take on the job. Occasionally people mistake this as a lack of desire to help them, but this could not be more wrong. If we are not the best fit for something – We just won’t do it.

Honesty - We don’t lie about your problem to milk you for more money. We never misrepresent what we are doing, such as replacing an external hard drive cable and charging you for data recovery.

Goodwill - When the manufacturer will offer superior service to us. We never let someone pay us for a repair that the manufacturer will perform for free. There are many occasions upon which you will be better off going to the OEM because your device may be covered under warranty or a recall. When we know this to be the case, we’ll suggest you try them.
